lambda-code
============

This gives sample code for the my article on Java 8 lambdas on IBM
developerWorks, all in the `com.sosnoski.lambdaintro` package. The `Name` and `NameSort` classes
are shown in the article. The `NameTimes` class just runs some microbenchmarks on different types
of lambda expressions (no surprises in the results, so I didn't include this in the article).
